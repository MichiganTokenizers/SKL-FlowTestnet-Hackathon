/// Transaction to stake collected league fees using Flow Actions
/// Uses native Flow staking approach (simplified - holds tokens)
///
/// This transaction demonstrates the Flow Actions pattern:
/// 1. Source connector aggregates collected league fees
/// 2. Sink connector prepares tokens for Flow native staking
/// 3. Single atomic transaction ensures safety
///
/// Note: Full Flow native staking requires FlowStakingCollection setup
/// This version holds tokens in the sink as a working proof-of-concept
///
/// @param leagueId: Unique identifier for the league
/// @param nodeID: Flow validator node ID to delegate to
/// @param totalTeams: Total number of teams in the league
/// @param paidTeams: Number of teams that have paid their fees
/// @param collectedAmount: Total FLOW collected from all teams
///
